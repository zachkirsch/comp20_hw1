Comp 20 - Assignment 1
By:  Zach Kirsch
Due: 12 February 2015

1. I believe all expectations of the assignment have been met
	- http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~zkirsc01/ redirects to
	  http://www.zachkirsch.github.io.
	- Three pages (index.html, bio.html, resume.html).
	  resume.html has more than 5 CSS rules (as required).
	  All files pass the official validations.
2. I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment. However, I did do
   some research to learn about CSS/HTML, and did take the specific font
   specifications from an online source:
	http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/better-helvetica/
3. I spent about 10 hours on this assignment, but some of that time was
   learning about HTML and CSS.
