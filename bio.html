  <p>I'm from Cleveland, Ohio (go Cavs!), and am now a freshman at Tufts University. I'm pursuing majors in computer science and math, and I'm also planning on studying economics.</p>
  <p>At Tufts, I'm a member of Engineers without Borders, Tufts Financial Group, and the Debate Society. I also enjoy swimming and the gym and hanging with friends.</p>
  <p>I spend some of my free time working on personal projects, which usually involve programming that will be helpful in debate or in my daily life.</p>
